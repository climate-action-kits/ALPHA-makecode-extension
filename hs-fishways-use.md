## Activity 1: Build Your Project @showdialog
Let's explore fish migration! We are going to do this in four parts: 
1. **Build** our fishway
2. **Add code** to bring our project to life  
3. **Use** sensors to understand how they work  
4. Apply what we learned with a small **challenge**

## Activity 2: Code Your Project @showdialog
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code!

The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bit what to do.

## Code Step 1 @showdialog
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside the ``|Download|`` button, then click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

## Code Step 3
Click the ``|Download|`` button to download the starter code to your project.

## Activity 3: Use Your Project @showdialog
Now that we've built our fishway, we'll start by **using** the sample code to see how it works.

As you go through the next steps:

* **Use** the instructions at the top of the screen.  
* When you are ready for more information, click **'Tell Me More!'**  
* If you need help with the code, click the **lightbulb!**
